The Player Directory
--------------------

This file gives a brief description of the contents in the player directory.

Player files are XML files organized in separate directories based on their
first letter. The average player file is around 40 kilobytes or so.

There is one default player file included by default. The username is
"Superuser" and the password is "password". You'll want to change or remove
that before going live since that login is common knowledge.
