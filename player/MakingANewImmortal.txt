1. Create a level 1 character.  Camp and exit.
2. Edit the character's file to set their level to 60-65 depending on the level immortal you're creating.
3. Log the character in again.  This will create the immortal data for that character.
4. If you have another overlord, you can now use imtlset on that player to grant skills.
   Otherwise they will have to log out and you will need to edit the ImmortalSkills section
   of their player file.  You can't do this in #2 because that section doesn't exist until
   they're above mortal level.
