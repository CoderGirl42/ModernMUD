<p>A &quot;reset&quot; is a load command 
  that is executed at zone load time. These commands are typically used to load 
  objects and mobiles into the zone. Without resets to load them, created objects 
  and mobs will not be visible in the game.  </p>

<p>The drop-down list and left/right 
  arrows let you navigate forward and backward through the list of repops.</p>
<p>Each repop has some custom values 
  depending on the type. For instance, the &quot;M&quot; repop is the &quot;load 
  mobile&quot; command and needs to know what mob to load and what room to load 
  it in. As you select each different command type, the value labels will change 
  to reflect what data is used.</p>
<p>Each field has a selector button 
  next to it. This can be used to select items of the type. For instance, the 
  button next to the &quot;Object Index&quot; box brings up a list of objects 
  to select from.</p>
