<h1>ModernMUD Editor Overview</h1>
<h4><a href="index.htm">Back to the index</a></h4>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to edit an area (also known 
  as a zone), you need to start by loading or creating one. This can be done via 
  the File --&gt; New or File --&gt; Open menu commands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Areas consist of a few major types 
  of things:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <a href="MobEdit.htm">Mobs</a><br>
  <a href="ObjectEdit.htm">Objects</a><br>
  <a href="RoomEdit.htm">Rooms</a><br>
  <a href="ShopEdit.htm">Shops</a><br>
  <a href="QuestEdit.htm">Quests</a><br>
  <a href="ResetEdit.htm">Resets</a><br>
  <a href="RepopEdit.htm">Repop Points</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each of these can be edited using 
  the icons on the left side the menu bar, in order. After the edit icons, the 
  next six icons (directional arrows plus U and D) shift the map display north, 
  south, west, east, up, or down. This lets you view parts of the map that hang 
  off the edge of the display, or that are on different levels. The indicators 
  after the icons show your X and Y offset (how far the map is shifted from center) 
  as well as which level you are viewing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main window has two different views -- the map view (shown above), and 
  the walkthrough view (shown below). The view can be changed by clicking the 
  corresponding tab.Along the bottom 
  of the window some information is displayed: The area name, the file location, 
  and the quantity of each type of data in the area.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="MainWindow2.png" width="624" height="540"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In walkthrough mode, commands can 
  be entered as if you were inside the zone. Movement and information commands 
  are available as are some editing commands. Type &quot;commands&quot; to see 
  the full list of available commands. Walkthrough mode may be easier for some 
  people to use when editing an area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the &quot;tools&quot; menu are 
  two selections: &quot;Renumber Area&quot;, which lets you automatically change 
  all of the index numbers of objects, rooms, and mobs to start with a new number, 
  and &quot;Check Area&quot;, which analyzes the area and reports any items that 
  haven't been filled in, such as room descriptions, mob names, and object keywords. 
  Items in the error report can be double-clicked to jump to the edit window for 
  that item.</font></p>
