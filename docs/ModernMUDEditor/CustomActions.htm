<h1>Custom Actions</h1>
<h4><a href="index.htm">Back to the index</a></h4>
<p>Custom actions allow you to add flavor and variety to your
mobiles or objects.  They are a simple system of triggers and resulting actions.</p>
<p>Each trigger has a percent chance of executing.  Each trigger 
    also has a data field that may or may not be used depending on the type.</p>

    drop-down, set the value by either typing in the text box or clicking one
