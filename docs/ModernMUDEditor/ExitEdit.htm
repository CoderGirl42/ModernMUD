<h1>Editing Exits</h1>
<h4><a href="index.htm">Back to the index</a></h4>
<p>Exits are used when traveling from 
  one room to another. They can be open passages or doorways.</p>
<p>The edit exit dialog can be reached 
  by clicking on any of the directional indicators (n, s, e, w, nw, sw, ne, se, 
  up and dn) within the room edit dialog.</p>
<p><img src="EditExit.png"></p>
<p><strong>Target Room</strong>: This 
  is the room the exit leads to.</p>
<p>You can click the &quot;Find&quot; 
  button to select the target room from a list, or click &quot;New&quot; to create 
  a new room and link it to this exit. In this case, clicking &quot;New&quot; 
  would link the east exit in room 6709 to a new, empty room and link the west 
  exit in the new room to room 6709.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword</strong>: These are 
  the exit keywords, if any. Each keyword is separated by a space. These keywords 
  are used with doors, so if you set a keyword of &quot;gate&quot;, someone could 
  open the door by typing &quot;open gate&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Flags</strong>: These are 
  flags that apply to the exit, such as secret, blocked, and no-bash.</p>
<p><strong>Key</strong>: If this exit 
  is lockable, this is the object that is used for the key, if any.</p>
<p>You can click the &quot;Find&quot; 
  button to select the key object from a list.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This 
  is the description shown when someone looks at the exit using one of the keywords.</p>
<p>&quot;Apply&quot; stores the exit 
  changes, &quot;Cancel&quot; closes the window without saving the exit changes, 
  and &quot;Delete&quot; removes an existing exit.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you created a new target 
  room for this exit using the &quot;New&quot; button, clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; 
  or &quot;Delete&quot; will not delete it, nor will it delete the exit pointing 
  from that new room to the one currently being edited.</em></p>
