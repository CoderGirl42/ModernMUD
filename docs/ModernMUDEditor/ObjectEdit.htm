<h1>Editing Objects</h1>
<h4><a href="index.htm">Back to the index</a></h4>
<p>Objects are the things that players 
  interact with in the game world. They can be weapons, armor, treasure, trinkets, 
  trash, furniture, traps, or even food.</p>
<p><img src="EditObjects.png"></p>
<p>The index number is a unique number 
  that is used by the mud to refer to the object.</p>
<p>The name keywords is a list of words, 
  separated by spaces, that can be used to refer to the object when using commands 
  like &quot;get&quot;, &quot;wear&quot;, &quot;drop&quot;, and &quot;wield&quot;.</p>
<p>The short description is an object's 
  &quot;short name&quot;, which is shown in a person's equipment list, inventory, 
  and in othe rplaces.</p>
<p>The full description is the text 
  that is shown when the item is sitting in a room or when it is examined.</p>
<p>Extended descriptions are descriptions 
  or bits of text that are shown when someone looks or examines a specific keyword. 
  For instance, for a &quot;dagger with a ruby in the hilt&quot; you could add 
  an extra description that is shown on the keyword &quot;ruby&quot;. When a person 
  types &quot;examine ruby&quot;, they will be shown a description of the ruby. 
  An object can have any number of extra descriptions.</p>
<p>The &quot;edit values&quot; button 
  lets you edit values specific to the type of item you are editing. For instance, 
  weapons have a damage type (i.e. slashing) and a weapon type (i.e. scimitar 
  or halberd) that can be set.</p>

<p>The &quot;edit affect&quot; button 
  lets you add affects to an object.</p>
<p>The &quot;edit spells&quot; button 
  lets you edit spells associated with an object. It is used for setting the spell 
  affects of a potion, scroll, wand, or other magical item.</p>
<p>The &quot;edit custom actions&quot; 
  button lets you add custom scripts to the object, such as procs, spells cast 
  on command, or other special actions.</p>
