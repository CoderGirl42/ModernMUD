<h1>Editing Rooms</h1>
<h4><a href="index.htm">Back to the index</a></h4>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rooms are what makes a zone take 
  its shape -- they're the locations where players travel while experiencing the 
  content of the zone.</font></p>
<p><img src="EditRooms.png" width="409" height="491"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The drop down list and left/right 
  arrows let you navigate through the available rooms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Name: This is the title of the room. 
  It is also shown when someone uses the 'exits' command.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Description: This is the detailed 
  description of the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Index #: This is the number of the 
  room. Rooms should be numbered automatically when you create them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Terrain: This is the terrain type 
  of the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flags: These are the various flags 
  and settings that can be applied to a room, such as no-magic or single-file.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Current and Current Dir: If an aquatic 
  room, this is the current strength in percent and the direction of the current.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fall chance: If this room has a down 
  exit, this is the chance of falling per turn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Map sector: This is only used for 
  worldmap zones.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Extended Descriptions list box 
  lets you add custom descriptions that are displayed when a player looks at specific 
  keywords.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exits section lets you add exits 
  to other rooms. Click on the directional button to edit exit data for that direction. 
  Buttons with grayed text do not have exits in that direction yet, while buttons 
  with black text do.</font></p>
