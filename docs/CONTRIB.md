Contributing to ModernMUD
-------------------------

We'd love to have contributions. This project is too large and ambitious to be
built entirely by one person alone.  We could use help improving the clients
for all platforms, improving the tools, and making the MUD engine more flexible
so that it could be use for many types of MUD, not just high-fantasy PvP games.

We're sure there are plenty of bugs to be fixed, documentation to add or
clarify, and examples/tutorials to be created. We'd love to have non-code
contributions, too.

All contributors will be required to sign a transfer of copyright form in order
to assign rights to their IP to the project. We want this project to be
unencumbered by licensing issues, and that's the best way to do so.
