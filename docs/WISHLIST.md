Wish List
---------

These are features we hope to have in ModernMUD one day.

- A WebSocket client implementation.

  It would be nice to be able to put up a web client that doesn't require
  Silverlight. The best option is probably SuperWebSocket at 
  http://superwebsocket.codeplex.com/

  Ideally you should be able to run a game where people can use their choice
  of telnet or web sockets.

- Full ChatterBot support.

  Right now it's just a basic set of classes with rudimentary implementation.

- Detailed gameplay configuration options.

  We'd like it to be possible to easily configure the game to have or not have
  things like free-for-all PvP, player corpse looting, or even disabling combat
  altogether for MUSH-like storytelling. Other game mechanics like the maximum
  number of levels and mob AI behavior should also be controlled via configuration.
  Not everyone wants a PvP MUD like Basternae, so it should be possible to easily
  change the game behavior to suit your game without having to delete or disable
  large chunks of code.

- Easy to customize client UI options.

  The first step is to let people configure/use their own world map tile sets,
  but there should be extra support for customizing the world maps and client
  look and feel for your MUD.
  
- Kickass documentation.

  Better documentation is always a good idea. We want good code documentation, 
  overview docs, tutorials and howtos, in-game player documentation (help), and
  builder instructions.

- Fancy mob AI.

  Mob AI on Basternae 1/2 was better than that on most MUDs, but there's more that
  could be done.

- Good ranged combat.

  Generally tough to get right, but it's neat when it works.

- A way to implement a crafting system.

  This is probably a big project, but player crafting is a big draw for some
  people. Getting it right in a way that doesn't throw off game balance is tough,
  but that can be left to game administrators as long as we design it in a way
  that is flexible and easy-to-configure.
