The Sys Directory
-----------------

This directory contains configuration and data files related to the MUD.

These files are included:

Ban.xml: This contains site ban information. When people just don't know how
to behave, a site ban is your "weapon of last resort" that blocks their ISP
(domain) from connecting to the MUD.

Bounties.xml: This contains player bounty information. When someone offers
a bounty on another player, it's stored here.

Chatterbots.xml: This is where "chatterbots" are stored - Eliza-style chat
bots.

Corpses.xml: This contains all player corpses. When a player dies, all of their
equipment remains on their corpses until someone loots it or the corpse decays.
The corpse file allows corpses to persist across boots.

Crimes.xml: This is where "crimes" are stored. It is used for justice, where
a player can commit crimes in justice areas and be wanted by the officials.

Fraglist.xml: This file contains data related to the "frag list", a scoreboard
of PvP wins and losses.

Help.xml: Contains data used by the help system. Can be edited by the help
editor.

Issues.xml: Contains bug reports, ideas, and other issues.

Playecounts.csv: This file is genereated by the MUD. It contains a count of
the number of players logged into the system each hour. It can be used for
your own information, generating graphs of the number of logged-in players,
or whatever.

Screens.xml: Contains ANSI and related screens for menus.

Socials.xml: Contains definitions for social actions.

Sysdata.xml: This contains system-wide MUD information, data, and configuration.
It contains game configration information, time and weather data, and related
