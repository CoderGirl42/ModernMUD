These are:

Combat         Miscellaneous            Character Info
Classes        Races                    Skills
Economy        Magic                    Inventory
Communiction   Party                    Movement
Guilds         Administration*

* = Administrators only

You can get more information on any of these topics by typing:
'help &lt;section name&gt;'.  For example, 'help movement' would bring up
a list of all the commands related to movement.  From there, you can
type 'help &lt;command name&gt;' for any command listed and get detailed
descriptions of the command.

The overlands seem to be made of two distinct areas, which are
further broken up by oceans.

The first area ("help map1") is more mountainous in nature, while
the other is semi-tropical ("help map2").

I have made no attempt to map the complicated Underdark, the vast
cavernous passages that form a labyrinth under the surface.  The
Underdark is the realm of evil creatures that hate the light
and all who dwell in it.  I feel that such an exploration must
wait until a later date when I can put together a larger and
more powerful expeditionary force.

In addition, there's the entirely different matter of the different
planes of existence.  I cover these in another section of my
journal ("help plane").</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>-1</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>MAP1</Keyword><Text>+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>-1</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>NEWBIE</Keyword><Text>Welcome to ModernMUD.  If you are an experienced player of Duris, Basternae,
Basternae II, Toril, or similar muds, you can probably skip over this greeting
since most of the commands are similar to what you are used to.

If this is your first time on this mud, we'd like you to spend a moment or
two reading this so you become accustomed to our game.

First we'll start with a warning: This is a PKILL mud.  You can and will be
attacked by other players.  The objective of this game is to kill those on
the other side of the racewars, but there are those on your own side who
will prey on you if you are weaker than them.  Races on the evil side of the
racewars are especially guilty of this type of play.  Use your wits (and the
"flee" command) to escape and learn the game.  

Secondly, read "HELP STORY".  It will give you some background information
on the theme of this MUD.

Your character will start as a level one of whatever class you chose in a
hometown assigned to your race type.  Look over your starting equipment using
the "equipment" and "inventory" commands.  Explore your hometown a bit,
get used to the combat and spell system, and feel free to "petition" any
questions you might have.

"HELP INDEX" will provide you a jumping grounds to various other topics of
interest.  Magma is a complex mud, but once you get used to our style you'll
see that playing here can be a very rewarding experience.

Thanks and have fun,
The ModernMUD Administrative Staff

on ModernMUD, this rules section is rather lengthy and boring.  It has
been broken down into numerous sub-topics to make finding a certain rule
easier.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE RULES.  IGNORANCE OF A RULE
IS NO EXCUSE FOR BREAKING A RULE.  

The following topics are available:

     HELP RULES GENERAL       - general policies and rules
     HELP RULES EQUIPMENT     - rules concerning equipment and how
                                it should be used

                                killing
     HELP RULES NAMES         - rules regarding names of players</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES NAMES NAME</Keyword><Text>ModernMUD is not necessarily a role-playing mud, but we do have strict
standards on names of the players.  We will not accept any of the
following:

Type                                           Example
Foul language                                  No example should be needed
"Real" names                                   Brian, Casey, Leon
Real words, compound words, or slang terms     Dagger, Windwalker
Names of characters from books, movies, etc.   Gandalf, Belgarion, Drizzt
Variations using intentional spelling errors,  Whysper, Blayde
backwards spellings, hooked on phonics
Historical figures                             Arthur, Patton
Random garbage                                 Diouhljl, Xxxxxx
Obvious storage character names                Skistore
Insulting or demeaning names                   Skisucks, Bitemeski
Names of gods or dieties                       Thor, Hermes

All of the above rules apply to both English and non-English languages.

Basically, try to make up a fantasy name that you aren't "stealing"
from another source.

If we catch you with an illegal name, we'll usually ask you to
petition a new name.  We'll rename you and you won't have to delete
or re-roll.  However, certain names will get you termed immediately
(those using foul language or insults).  If you're really stupid
about it, we'll have no qualms about sitebanning you.

If you feel your name is borderline, just petition and we'll be more
than happy to made a judgement call on it.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES GENERAL</Keyword><Text>1.  DON'T DO ANYTHING THE OVERLORDS WILL CONSIDER CHEESY.  This rule
    should cover all the miscellaneous situations that aren't covered
    specifically in the rules.  Even if we don't state something is
    illegal in the rules, doesn't mean it's not.  If the gods feel you
    are doing some abusive that's not in the spirit of the game, you
    will be punished.

2.  Players shoud settle their own disputes.  Talking to a god should
    be a last resort.  Use the petition channel if you need to consult
    with a god, but try to deal with matters yourself first.

3.  Hacking or stealing the password of other people's characters is
    not allowed.

4.  Trading or giving away characters is not allowed.  The person that
    originally created the character must play it at all times.  The
    only exception to this rule is shared storage characters, which is
    discussed in HELP RULES MULTI.

5.  You may only have a single guilded character at any time.

6.  Immortals may not have mortal player characters.  The temptation to
    cheat is far too great for anyone to bear.  In every incarnation of
    Basternae, when immortals have had mortal characters, things have
    gone horribly wrong.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES EQUIPMENT</Keyword><Text>READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY: Your primary character must wear his
best gear at all times. This means you have to wear your best stuff
for raids, zones, and scouting.

Secondary characters must also use the best equipment available to
them that is NOT in use by the primary character.  This also includes
using the secondaries for raiding, zoning, and scouting of any kind.

If you're unsure about which character is primary and which are
secondaries, don't risk it.  Always move gear between the character
you are currently using.  If the admin's think what you're doing is
cheesy, you'll be termed.

In addition, you must do your absolute best to equip your characters
before raiding.  If you have equipment on your storage character, use
it.  If the guild storage chest contains stuff, take it.  If you have
money (either your own or belonging to the guild), you must take it
and make every effort to purchase the best equipment you can.  Do not
decline equipment offered to you by friends simply because you want to
raid and don't want to risk losing it.

You may NEVER raid or scout naked or with newbie/minor created equipment,
even if you have nothing on storage.  You must re-equip before raiding,
or scouting.

The only exception to the "best equipment" rules is for corpse retrieval
_immediately_ after a death.  If you die, you may attempt to go back to
your corpse and retrieve ONLY YOUR EQUIPMENT.  You may not try to get
equipment from the corpses of other members of your party.  _Immediately_
means three minutes.  If you can't get to your corpse in three minutes
or less, don't go out until you have fully equipped again.

Even this exception has an exception, however.  In a racewars situation,
you cannot keep going out to loot.  You can go out ONE TIME after you
die to attempt to get your corpse.  After that, you must re-equip
fully before attempting to get your corpse.

Lets give an example to show what I mean:

An evil guild and a goodie guild fight near the goodie guild's hall.  The
evils win, and are in the process of looting equipment from the corpses.

One goodie who died, lets call him Toom, runs back out to try and loot
his corpse.  He dies again.  He may not perform any more CR actions
until he is fully re-equipped.  His other guild members may not attempt
to loot his corpse until they are fully equipped (but they may each make
one attempt to loot their own corpses).</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES ARTIFACTS</Keyword><Text>Artifacts must be on "primary" characters.  Since the issue of "primary"
characters can get confusing, use your best judgement and/or ask the
administrators.  If you have a character in a guild, that character is
your primary, regardless of playtimes.

A single character can only have one artifact.

Artifacts must always be equipped or carried.  This means that you
can't give an artifact to someone to 'protect' it, you shouldn't 
drop and hide it to avoid losing it, etc.  About to get killed by
a mob that might turn you into a dracolich and nuke all of your
equipment? Bummer, you HAVE to keep that artifact with you.  The
only way you should pass off an artifact that you are actively 
using is when it is pried from your dead fingers.  If you acquire 
an artifact that you are unable to use, yes, you an give it away
to someone that can, but once you do, it is theirs to keep or
lose.

Even if you can't use an artifact (like goodies getting a shaman 
artifact), it must be carried so that the other side has a chance
to get it back.

If the admin's feel the player holding an artifact isn't "active"
enough, the artifact will be taken and put back to its original location.

Artifacts are on a "random load" timer and do not load up every boot
in zones.  This means that if an artifact is reset and put back in
its home, it will not be there every boot.

If you are unsure if a piece of equipment is considered an artifact,
ask.  For the most part any unique piece of equipment, including
stuff from quests, is considered an artifact, even if it's not
completely overpowering.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES BUGS</Keyword><Text>1.  Report all bugs you find using the 'bug' command.  If it's an
    emergency, use the 'petition' command to inform the gods.

2.  Once you've reported the bug, do not continue to use it.

3.  If you find a bug, don't report it, and continue to use it, you
    will be punished.

4.  Bugs consist of errors in the code and errors in zones, such as
    the infamous "money bugs" that crop up.

</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES MULTI RULES MULTI-PLAYING</Keyword><Text>Multi-playing is a complex and confusing part of the game, and one that
you should make every effort to understand.  Failure to follow the
policies set in these rules will result in HARSH punishment.  Ignorance is
not an excuse.

1.  You may NOT have more than one character on at ANY time.  THIS
    INCLUDES LINK-DEAD CHARACTERS.  You must rent or camp out your other
    character BEFORE you bring on a new one.  The ONLY exception is as
    follows:  you may have two characters on in the same room (in an inn
    or other rentable location) for the purpose of exchanging or storing
    equipment.

2.  You may NOT bring on a character belonging to the opposite side of the
    racewars for ONE HOUR after logging off the first character.  No
    exceptions to this rule will be allowed.

   Example: Madra is a Gnome and gets bored of playing for a while.  She
   decides to log on a newbie Drow Elf.  Ooops, big mistake on her part,
   since she's now broken rule number two and we kindly admins nuke both
   chars.

3.  You may NOT bring on another character for the purpose of using it
    to act as a "translator" to get around the language barrier.

4.  You may NOT bring on another character in order to retrieve
    equipment for a character that has died, REGARDLESS of whether that
    other character's corpse has decomposed or not.  This includes, but is
    not limited to, creating "newbies" to retrieve corpses or eq
    REGARDLESS of who's corpse is being retrieved.

5.  You may NOT use a second character to cast spells on another. This
    rule also applies to logging another character on as a "target" for a 
    spell.

6.  You CANNOT share characters.  You cannot give a character away. You
    cannot loan characters out for any reason. If we catch you, we will
    delete every character you have.  To make sure you understand: You
    can NOT loan or trade characters.  

   Example1: Tony is a player with a high level shaman and secondary high
   level warrior.  He wants to go out and raid with his shaman, but wants
   a basher along with him.  He asks a friend of his to play his warrior
   for a while so they can group and go kill people.  Later on, Tony logs
   out his shaman and starts playing the warrior himself.  Oooops, big
   mistake on his part, because Tony just broke rule number eight and now
   both characters will be terminated.

    The only exception to this is shared storage characters, which may
    never leave the inn room they are rented in.  A maximum of three people
    may share a storage character.

7.  You may not trade or give characters to other people.  Once a player
    is created, the same person must play that character until he is
    deleted.  You may not trade one character for another, nor may you
    give a character away for free or for reimbursement of any kind.

8.  You may NOT use a second character with the sole purpose being to
    camp near an equipment repop site or to act as a portal/moonwell
    target for a zone. Despite the importance of equipment, hoarding
    equipment by this means is deplorable, dishonorable, and ILLEGAL.
    Using characters as a target for racewars in this fashion is also
    illegal.

9.  You may NOT log on another character to take revenge for another
    of your character's that was just killed, looted, stolen from, hit
    with a spell, or had any other ill effect placed on him by another
    character FOR TWO HOURS after the incident occurred.
  
10. You may NEVER scout with low level characters or newbies, just to
    avoid risking a primary or high level secondary character.  Using
    newbies to scout for targets for raids or to do corpse retrieval/
    looting is extremely cheesy and will result in angry admins.

11. You cannot transfer equipment from a character on one side of the
    racewars to another.  This means if you have a stacked goodie char and
    want to start playing an evil character, you must get all new stuff
    with the evil.  You cannot have other people transfer the gear for
    you, and you most certainly cannot have someone kill and loot your
    first character and give it to the second.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES PUNISHMENT</Keyword><Text>The administrative staff for ModernMUD can deal with the players any
way they want.  We don't have to give you a warning or a second chance
(but we usually do).  

We do not have set policies for punishment.  It's up to each individual
god to deal with things how he sees fit.

We can and will siteban people who we don't want playing on Magma.
If a siteban "hurts" innocent bystanders because they can no longer
connect to Magma, we're sorry, but that happens.  Sitebanning is
our final option and we don't like doing it.

If you lose an item to a mistake or bug, you will not be given a

and should be treated with respect.  We don't care if you like us, but
we won't tolerate extreme insults or slander.

The immortals of ModernMUD can and do play mortal characters, but make
every effort to keep mortal and immortal affairs seperate.  The
administrators of Magma do not show favortism to one racewars side
or another.  We make changes to the game based on game balance issues,
not our mortal characters, guilds, or personal interests.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>RULES RACEWARS</Keyword><Text>1.  Player killing is legal and expected.  The objective of the game is
    to kill players on the opposite side of the racewars, but same side
    pkilling is allowed.

2.  Player killing in goodie hometowns is affected by the JUSTICE code.
    Read help justice for more information.

3.  If you have multiple characters, you may not use one of the characters
    to gain revenge for the death, looting, or any other ill effects that
    happen to your other character until a period of two hours has passed.

4.  If you involved in any racewars situation (attacking or scouting)
    you may not log on another character to take part in any racewars
    activity for two hours.

    To give you an example, lets say your level 15 goblin warrior runs
    into some goodies in a zone.  Regardless of whether your warrior
    was attacked or not, as long as he or a group member spotted the
    goodies in any fashion, you cannot log in another character for
    two hours to do any type of raiding, counter-raiding, and so on.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>-1</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso>history</SeeAlso><Syntax>!&lt;number&gt;</Syntax><Keyword>!</Keyword><Text>The ! command recalls the most recently used command from your command history and executes it again.

Anti-paladins are the anti-thesis of paladins.  They serve the evil gods and
seek to bring nothing but pain and suffering to the world.  

Anti-paladins, like paladins, get limited spellcasting abilities granted by
their gods.  These abilities increase as their level increases, showing the
anti-paladin to be gaining favor with his chosen diety.  

Anti-paladins have the innate ability to detect good, and have some limited
protection from good.  Anti-paladins are superb fighters when wielding
two-handed weapons and have trained so that they can bash effectively when
not using a shield.  Anti-paladins are granted the powers of
'vampiric touch', their dark gods granting the ability to heal themselves as
they do damage to others.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Wisdom
Races: Orc, Githyanki, Githyzerai
Equipment: Anti-Paladins can use almost all weapons and armor.  They are
           limited in the types of magical items such as wands, staves, or
           scrolls.

obtain and there is only one of the artifacts in the game....EVER.

Artifacts must be on "primary" characters.  Since the issue of "primary"
characters can get confusing, use your best judgement and/or ask the
administrators.  If you have a character in a guild, that character is
your primary, regardless of playtimes.

A single character can only have one artifact.

Artifacts must always be equipped or carried.  This means that you
can't give an artifact to someone to 'protect' it, you shouldn't 
drop and hide it to avoid losing it, etc.  About to get killed by
a mob that might turn you into a dracolich and nuke all of your
equipment? Bummer, you HAVE to keep that artifact with you.  The
only way you should pass off an artifact that you are actively 
using is when it is pried from your dead fingers.  If you acquire 
an artifact that you are unable to use, yes, you an give it away
to someone that can, but once you do, it is theirs to keep or
lose.

Even if you can't use an artifact (like goodies getting a shaman 
artifact), it must be carried so that the other side has a chance
to get it back.

If the admin's feel the player holding an artifact isn't "active"
enough, the artifact will be taken and put back to its original location.

Artifacts are on a "random load" timer and do not load up every boot
in zones.  This means that if an artifact is reset and put back in
its home, it will not be there every boot.

If you are unsure if a piece of equipment is considered an artifact,
ask.  For the most part any unique piece of equipment, including
stuff from quests, is considered an artifact, even if it's not
completely overpowering.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>-1</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>ASSASSIN</Keyword><Text>Rogue sub-class

Assassins are trained killers, men and women who cloak themselves in dark and
shadows in order to slay their chosen victims.  Assassins are the masters of
the "instant kill", surprising a foe and murdering it in a single strike.
Assassins are experts in the arts of backstabbing, placing a dagger or two
right in the vital areas of a target and causing horrendous damage.  Most
assassins work alone, although some work in teams in order to bring down
difficult opponents.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility

Races: Human, Half-Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Githyzerai, Orc, Drow Elf, Githyanki,
       Rakshasa

Equipment: Assassins are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes sneaking
           in shadows impossible.

Bard are a unique clss, mixing a blend of rogue skills with magical abilities
granted by their music.  Bards are traveling entertainers, telling tales and
singing songs of lore and heroism.

Bards use instruments and song to create magical effects.  The power of their
music may not be as powerful as a mage's magic, but many of the bard's
"spells" are unique to his class and very beneficial to the bard's entire
party.  Bards are truly suited for large groups.

Not even the greatest of bards can sing indefinitely, however, and when the
throat of a bard gets sore, he must rest to regain his strength.  This is
represented by a bard's "mana", which regenerates over time.  Each song a
bard plays takes a certain amount of mana.  Certain songs can be continuously
sung, draining mana over a period of time.

Berzerk represents a massive adrenaline rush and an almost mindless rage
and need to kill.  Berzerking causes a person to ignore his personal safety
and that of his friends in his lust for blood.

When berzerked, the strength and constitution of the player go up, but
dexterity, agility, intelligence, and wisdom all drop.  The player will do
more damage and have more health, but will be easier to hit as well.  When
the effect wears off, the player will return to his normal stats.  If the
drop in hit points because of the player's constitution takes his total to
less than 0, he will die.

You cannot cast spells, flee, or perform many other actions while berzerked.
While berzerk, you may attack friends because of the blinding rage you are
engulfed in.

You can attempt to start/stop a berzerk rage by typing 'berzerk'.  Your level

for the player.

The spell being cast must be in the caster's memory.  Magic users must
memorize their spells from spellbooks using the MEMORIZE command, while
priests use the PRAY command and do not need spellbooks.

NOTE: A mage has a "virtual spellbook" with them at all times.  This
virtual spellbook only requires that a mage scribe a spell once from
a teacher and he will know it forever.  His proficiency at casting that
spell will go up as his skill with that spell increases.

If the spell name is more than one word, you must enclose it in a single
quote.  For example: cast 'cure light wounds' Ski, where Ski is the target
of the spell.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.

You can also abbreviate spell names.  You must type in a minimum amount of
letters to make the spell "unique", so the mud knows which spell you mean.
For example, cast 'cure' Ski would not work for casting cure light wounds,
because there are multiple cure spells.  Typing cast 'cure l' Ski would,
since the other cure spells do not include the letter l.

Many spells require a target.  That target can be a player or an object.
If a spellcaster is casting a spell on himself, he can simply use "me" or
"self" as the target.  

If a spellcaster is casting an offensive spell while in combat, and the
target is the enemy the spellcaster is fighting, the spell will be
automatically directed at the enemy if no target is given.

CAST allows the use of the #.target format, where # is a number.  This
allows a player to choose a specific target from a group of players, mobs,
or items with the same keywords.

For example, if there were four demons in a room and the spellcaster wanted
to cast a fireball on the third one, he would type:

     cast 'fireball' 3.demon

Make sure you include the period between the number of the target and the
name.  If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, the
spell wouldn't work because it would attempt to cast the spell "3", which
obviously doesn't exist. 

There is help available for each individual spell.  The command "SPELLS"

This spell will restore life to a corpse, negating most of the
experience lost by the death, in the same manner as the "resurrect"
spell.  However, this spell has a greater chance of failure.

The power of this spell takes a toll on both the druid and the target
and both are exhausted by the procedure.

This spell is not without risks.  If the person being resurrected has
low constitution, the strain of being resurrected may be too great, in
which case the spell may fail, and the corpse will be incapable of
being restored to life.  If this spell fails to work on a corpse, the
corpse may not be resurrected by any other means, either.  Basically,
if a target fails a resurrection or cauldron spell, it cannot be ressed
later.

You must have the target's consent before performing a cauldron of
rebirth or the spell will fail.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>CAUSE CRITICAL</Keyword><Text>Spell

Clerics are men and women who gain magical powers granted by their gods.
Their deities give them great abilities which they use to further the goals
of their chosen gods and goddesses.

The deity a cleric worships is chosen by his or her race, and sometimes by
the clerics sex as well (in the case of the drow deities).  Each god or
goddess grants their follows with some unique spells and abilities.

Falling out of favor with one's god (usually because of a cleric's alignment
changing) can be very nasty.  Gods do not enjoy priests who turn away from
their religion.

Important Attributes: Wisdom

Races: Human, Grey Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Orc, Drow Elf,
       Duergar Dwarf, Goblin, Half-Elf, Flind

Equipment: Clerics are priests, and are restricted to using non-edged
           weapons such as clubs, maces, and flails.  Priests can wear
           most types of armor.

Innate Abilities: None

&amp;+WThe Book of Magma Ansi Codes&amp;n

First things first.  The main thing to understand when using our version of
ansi color is you can SET things, or CLEAR ALL (back to white on black), but
you cannot just turn off bold, or blink.  This means that once you have used
a color code that involves bold colors or blinking colors, you have to send
a CLEAR ALL signal or else everything after will remain bold or blinking.

There are 4 types of ansi control sequences:

&amp; &lt;N&gt; | &lt;n&gt; -   reset everything, back to 'n'ormal (white on black).  This is also
             done for every newline, to eliminate 'bleed-through' colors.
&amp; + &lt;color&gt; -  set foreground color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BOLD
             (bright/light) bit is also set (and will STAY set until either
             a newline, or &amp;&lt;N&gt; is done).
&amp; - &lt;color&gt; -  set background color.  If the color letter is uppercase, the BLINK
             bit will be set (same as for &amp;+ above).

             &amp; = &lt;bg&gt;&lt;fg&gt; - set both background &lt;bg&gt; and foreground &lt;fg&gt; color, with exactly
             the same restrictions as for setting foreground and background
             colors seperately.

NOTE: There are no spaces in the color sequences.  Spaces are shown above only
      to prevent the parser from interpreting them as real color sequences.

COMPARE doesn't take into account any special affects on objects, so it can't

COMPARE with one object compares an object in your inventory to the object you

Dear (sirs/admins of ModernMUD/bastards/assholes),

I would like to file a (complaint/complaint/big complaint) about your mud,
ModernMUD.

I think ____________________________ (insert race/class here) is horribly
underpowered.  I mean, come ON!  They don't even get (triple 
attack/quadruple attack/deathfield/all of the above).  All of the other
(classes/races) are so much better than ________________________ (insert
race/class here) that it's not even fun to play anymore.  At the minimum,
you should give them ___________________ (insert new ability here), and
the following:

     ___ judgement
     ___ major para
     ___ biofeedback
     ___ instant-kill
     ___ dragon breath
     ___ other _______________________

(Goodies/evils) are also so much more powerful than my side of racewars, I
don't see how we can even play.  You gods are so biased for
(goodies/evils)!  Why do (goodies/evils) have _____________________ (insert
race/class/ability) here and we don't?

I have been playing this game since (you opened/Duris/pre-wipe Duris/beta 
Duris) so I know what I'm talking about.  I could run this mud
(10/100/1000/a jillion) times better than you guys.

So, in conclusion, you are the most (moronic/stupid/grossly incompetent)
(buffoons/jerks/spawns of Satan) to ever run a mud.  Maybe you gods should
stop (cheating/lying/performing lewd acts with your sister) and start
running a decent mud for a change.

The type of elemental that answers the mage's summons is random, but weighted towards the caster's focus plane or one of the adjacent ones.  A water elementalist, for example, would be most likely to get an elemental from the plane of water.  He is less likely to get one from one of the adjacent

plane opposite his own focus (fire to water, earth to air), and if he does... the elemental will most likely attack the caster, recognizing him as an enemy.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso>ORDER</SeeAlso><Syntax /><Keyword>CONJURE PECH</Keyword><Text>Spell

Druids are priests who gain their powers from nature itself.  They usually
live in the woods and forests and live to protect the trees and wildlife
contained within.  Attempting to harm a druid's forest in any way will bring
the priest's wrath.  Druids gain spells from the deities of the forests and
nature, and have some incredible powers at their disposal.  Many of these
spells must be cast in the outdoors, while others are just less effective
while inside.

In addition to normal spells, druids have special rituals.  These act as
spells, except they require multiple druids working together in a complex
weaving of nature's magical forces.  Many of these rituals are very
powerful and require longer periods of time to cast.

Important Attributes: Wisdom

Races: Human, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Centaur

Equipment: Druids are priests, and are restricted to using non-edged weapons 
           such as clubs, maces, and flails.  Priests can wear most types of 
           armor.

Elementalists focus on one of the major elements (air, fire, water, earth)
and learn to harness the power of that element for use in spellcasting.
Elementalists can conjure up beings of their chosen element, called
elementals, and have them serve as pets for short periods of time.  They
also gain other powerful spells from their studies, and the effects of those
spells vary wildly from one element to another.

As stated above, there are four types of elementalists.  The evil races are
more akin to the destructive powers of fire and air.  The good races are more
akin to the powers of earth and water.  Each element has an opposite (air and
earth, fire and water) and there are spells that are based on this opposition.

Important Attributes: Intelligence

Races: Air --- Human, Orc, Rakshasa
       Earth - Human, Half-Elf, Orc
       Fire -- Human, Gnome, Drow Elf, Flind, Rakshasa
       Water - Human, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Rakshasa

Equipment: Elementalists are spellcasters and are very limited in their use
           of weapons and armor.  They have an unsurpassed ability to use
           magical objects such as staves, wands, and scrolls.

looked down upon by many of the other evil races because of their small
stature, despite the fact that goblin shamans are dangerous casters.

In the world of the Underdark, where surviving from day to day is difficult,
goblins are survivors.  Despite their small size, goblins can adapt to
their environments very easy and learn to fit in.  If more powerful races
threaten to overwhelm a goblin village, they either flee to live another day

main goal of a goblin is to live to see another day.

Last Modified: 1/21/99

This guide, written by Ski, should take you through the steps you need to
perform when writing a guildhall for Magma.  It is intended for use with
the DE program, which can be obtained from the Basternae web page
(http://basternae.org).

This guide assumes you know how to use the DE program.  If you don't, you
shouldn't be making the guildhall.

This guide is broken down into numerous sections.  Type 'help construct1'
for the first section.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>CONSTRUCT1</Keyword><Text>1.  Contacting the admins
=========================

Before you start making the hall, you need to contact the Guildhall Admin.
This administrator will give you certain pieces of information you need
when making the zone.  He should give you the following pieces of
information:

1.  Starting vnum for rooms, objs, and mobs.
2.  Zone number
3.  Your association number
4.  A destination room number if you have a portal to a hometown.

You should tell the administrator where you would like the hall to go on the
map.  Guildhalls must be connected to one of the maps (either the overland
map or the underdark map), they must be reached by a "normal" exit (ie no
portals or teleports to the hall), the entrance to the hall must be at
ground level (no flying guildhalls), and they cannot be located within 5
"spaces" of another guildhall.  Goodie guilds cannot put halls in the
underdark, and evils cannot put halls on the main overland continent.

</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>CONSTRUCT2</Keyword><Text>2.  Creating the Guildhall
==========================

The second step is to make a brand new zone using the de program.  Easiest
way to do this is just to type:

de &lt;hallname&gt;  where &lt;filename&gt; should be something like "mowhall" (for the
               Masters of War guildhall).  
               
               Don't call the hall something generic like 'guild' or 'hall'.
               Make the name unique to your faction.
               
DE will bring up a few indicators letting you know it couldn't open any
files (since they don't exist yet).  It will then prompt you for the
starting vnum for rooms, objects, and mobs.  Enter the number that was
given to you by the Guildhall admin.

Enter a name for the zone when prompted.  Use something appropriate, such
as "Masters of War Guildhall".

Enter the zone number that was given to you by the Guildhall admin.  You
should now be in the DE program looking at the first room of the hall.

===========================

Type "edit zone".
The zone name and number should be correct, since you entered them when
  you first created the zone.
Type "C" to edit lifespan values and reset mode.
Type "C" again to edit the reset mode.
Change the value to "0" so the zone never resets.
Type "D" to edit the miscellaneous bits.
The zone should have the "D. No Teleport" bit set.  Nothing else should be
  selected.

=============================

The first room in the guildhall must be the golem room, and it must be
the room that will connect to the map.  This first room can have two
exits: one to the map and one into the hall.  The exit to the map can
be of any direction, but the exit into the hall cannot be a diagonal.

Edit the room and create an exit in the direction that you want to lead
to the map.  Link it to room -1.  The Guildhall admin will link the hall
to the map using this exit, once the guild is approved.

Continued in 'help construct5'</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>CONSTRUCT5</Keyword><Text>5.  Rules for Rooms
===================

Each room should follow these rules:

Rooms must have an appropriate name and a room description.

The following flags should be chosen.  Make sure nothing else is selected.

     D. Indoors
     G. No Recall
     M. No Precipitation
     P. No Teleport
     X. No Summon
     Y. Guild Room
     Z. Twilight
     2. No gate/planeshift

The "R. Heal" flag may be chosen, but this adds to the cost of the guildhall.

You may only have one healing room per hall.  See the Prices section of
this document to see how much a healing room costs.

The room should have sector type "B. City".

Rooms (except the golem) room can have any number of exits.  Exits may not
have any doors.  Exits must be "reversible", which means if you go east
from one room to get to another, you can go west to get back to the first
room.

Rooms should have a fall percentage chance of 0%, a mana flag of 0, mana
value of 0, current strength of 0, and current direction of 0 (all the
default values).

Continued in 'help construct6'</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>CONSTRUCT6</Keyword><Text>6. Rules for Golems
===================

Each hall can have up to 4 golems.  Golems must have an appropriate short
name, long name, keywords, and description.  These should correspond to
one another in a logical fashion.  For example, a golem could have:

Short name: 
"&amp;+ga&amp;n &amp;+Gglowing&amp;n &amp;+ggreen&amp;n &amp;+Ggolem&amp;n"

Long name: 
"&amp;+gA golem made of&amp;n &amp;+Gglowing&amp;n &amp;+ggreen stone blocks passage to north.&amp;n"

Keywords:
green golem glowing _guildgolem_ assoc1_n_0 _nomoney_ 

Description: 
&amp;+gA powerful magic has enchanted this solid block of green stone, creating a
powerful guardian that blocks passage to the north.  Occassionally, brilliant
pulses of bright green flash through the substance that makes up this golem,
like blood through veins.

Mobs must have the following keywords:
     golem
     _guildgolem_
     assoc1_N_0 (see below for details)
     _nomoney_

You may not use other keywords to affect the golems, such as _size_ flags.

The assoc1_N_0 keyword varies from hall to hall.  The "1" should be
replaced with your association number, given to you by the Guildhall
admin.  The "N" should be replaced with the exit direction that leads
further into the hall.  The "0" should be left alone.

So, for a guild with association number 4, and an exit leading east into
the hall, each golem would have the keyword:

assoc4_E_0

Remember, you may not have diagonal exits leading further into the hall.

=====

Submission Fee:                 500
A basic hall:                   7,000

Healing room:                   3,500
Teleporter:                    10,000 (first)
                               50,000 (second)

Payment must be made in platinum on the same day the guildhall is added
to the map.  It must be made by hand by one of the guild leaders.  

A submission fee must be paid each time a guildhall is sent in.  This
means if you send in a hall, decide you need to change something, you will
be fined an additional 500 platinum.

The inn, shop, and healing rooms are NOT additional rooms.  They must be
placed in existing rooms.  So, for example, you can't buy a basic
guildhall, an inn, a shop, and a healing room and have 8 rooms.  You would
buy the basic hall 3 rooms if you wanted 8 rooms total.  You can place the
inn, shop, and healing room in those 5 basic rooms, however.

Bulliten boards are free.

Teleporters allow instantaneous transportation from a guild hall to a
'friendly' city's inn.  Teleporters are one-way from the guild hall to
the inn.

When purchasing a teleporter for a guild hall, you must choose the
'friendly' city destination.  Friendly cities are those which are the
hometowns of a race on your side of the racewars.  So, a goodie guild
could install a teleporter that leads to the inn in Paranel, or an evil
guild could install a teleporter to the Bloodrock inn.

The guild's first teleporter costs 10,000 platinum.  The second costs
50,000 platinum.  No guild can have more than 2 teleporters.  The two
teleporters do not have to have the same destination.

NOTE: The costs are for the guild as a whole, not per guildhall.  So if
you had two guildhalls, and wanted a teleporter in each one, the cost
would be 60,000 platinum for both teleporters, and you would use up your
maximum of 2 teleporters.

Once added, teleporters are permanent.  They cannot be removed and the
destination cannot be changed.

Stables are not allowed.

Guild chests are buggy currrently, and cannot be purchased.

You may NOT modify an existing guild.  You can replace it (at full costs),
but you will get no credit for the existing hall.

Information you must submit when you send the guildhall in:
===========================================================

Location on the map where you want it linked.
Detailed breakdown of costs.
Room vnum of the inn.  You don't have to do anything in DE to create the inn.
The inn is part of the mud code, and is added by the Guildhall admin.
Mob vnums of the golems.

Entities that lack intelligence are much more susceptible to the magical
effects of an Illusion.  Creatures like Ogres and Centaurs will undoubtably
lack the cognizance to see an Illusion for what it is.

Illusionsts are also able to cast other sorts of magical spells since the
Illusionist is also a practicitioner of Magic.  Yet, the Illusionist uses
non-illusion spells to augment their own spells.

Very powerful Illusionists are capable of mixing illusion with reality to
provide an effect that does possess real aspects.  These powerful spells are
also capable of drawing creatures from the Plane of Shadow for short periods
of time.  These Shadow creatures can cause devestating results to the person
who is their chosen victim.  The culmination of reality with illusion gives
powerful Illusionists a vast arsenal.

Important Attributes: Intelligence

The mercenary is a blend of fighter and rogue, having some of the skills of
each.  While he can't match the warrior in fighting skills nor the assassin
in backstabbing abilities, the skills that the mercenary possess combine some
of the best from both worlds.

Mercenaries are soldiers for hire, bounty hunters, pirates, and smugglers.
They have the unique ability to try and capture a foe, and at high levels of
experience they learn how to crush the throat of a spellcaster.  Mercenaries
also have the headbutt skill, which they can use and attempt to knock out or
daze an opponent.

Important Attributes: Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Constitution

Races: Barbarian, Mountain Dwarf, Half-elf, Orc, Duergar Dwarf, Troll, Ogre
       Flind, Minotaur, Human

Equipment: Mercenaries are a fighter-rogue hybrid.  They can use most
           weapons.  Their choice of armor is extensive, but still somewhat
           limited when compared to a warrior.

Innate Abilities: None

Paladins are holy warriors, people who fight for their gods and attempt to
bring good to the world.  Paladins are given some limited spellcasting
abilities by their gods, but only as long as they strive to destroy what
is evil and vile in the world.  Paladins are experts with two-handed weapons,
gaining bonuses to hit as they go up in level.  In addition, paladins have a
much higher chance of successfully bashing an opponent without using a
shield.

Paladins can detect evil and have the ability to summon a mount when the need
arises.  Paladins can also layhands, channelling the healing power of their
god onto themselves or another person.

Paladins cannot group with anti-paladins, and most likely would attack such
an evil creature on sight.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Wisdom
Races: Human, Dwarf
Equipment: Paladins can use almost all weapons and armor.  They arel imited
           in the types of magical items such as wands, staves, or scrolls.
Innate Abilities: Layhands, Detect Evil, Summon Mount (at level 10),
                  Protection from Evil

Paladins, because of their religious nature, may NOT toggle vicious to on.
They cannot toggle AGGR on either.  Paladins can also LOSE experience from
attacking good-aligned creatures.  The following chart gives you an idea of
how experience is calculated for paladins:

Victim is evil or neutral with alignment less than 0:
     Full experience as normal

Victim is neutral with alignment equal to or more than zero and aggressive:
     Gain 1/5th normal experience

Victim is neutral with alignment equal to or more than zero and
 not aggressive:
     Lose 1/5th normal experience

Victim is good and aggressive:
     Gain 1/50th normal experience

Victim is good and non-aggressive:
     Lose experience equal to the normal amount

Most mobs consider the owner of the pet to be responsible for the pet's
actions.  If the pet attacks, the mob will most likely come after the owner
of the pet if the pet is killed.  Towns with justice systems may arrest pet
owners if the pet breaks any laws.

There are many planes of existance on which the creatures of the multi-verse
live.  Many know only of the "True Prime", the land of Magma itself.
Some narrowminded people think of this as our planet alone, but this is not
necessarily true.  The sun, other planetary systems, the stars... all reside
in the True Prime.

The other planes are completely different realms of existence.  They do not
touch our True Prime except by magical means.  These different planes are
accessible through many different spells such as 'plane shift', 'gate', and
the like.  Some creatures seem to have an innate ability to shift themselves
from one plane to another.  

To visualize the layout of the major planes of existence, think of the Astral
as a large diamond or sphere.  Along the equator of this sphere are the
Elemental Planes, spaced out equally.  The "opposing" elements are across
from one another (earth to air, fire to water).  Between these Elemental
Planes are the Paraelemental Planes, where two Elemental Planes intersect.

At the top of this sphere, there's the Positive Elemental Plane, and it's
opposite the Negative resides at the bottom.

Then, to top it all off, each of the Elemental Planes interacts with the
Positive and Negative, just as they interact with each other.  This creates
the Quasielemental Planes.

In theory, there could be an infinite amount of Elemental-related planes,
each caused by the lack of true "borders" between each of them.  The
Paraelemental Planes should interact with the Positive and Negative, and so
on.  This theory hasn't been proven by any explorers that I am familar with.

The Ethereal seems to exist everywhere and nowhere.  It's the realm of the
Demi-Planes, islands of matter in the Deep Ethereal that act much like the
True Prime in many cases.  Notable examples of this phenomenon are the
Demi-Plane of Dreams, the Demi-Plane of Shadows, and the Demi-Plane of Dread.  

Planes that are most commonly known are:

Astral - a dull silver expanse that seems to serve as a nexus for portals to
         other planes. 
Ethereal - another misty realm, though this one is full of color.  Split up
           into the Border Ethereal and the Deep Ethereal.

The Elemental Planes (sometimes called the Inner Planes) - these are the
places where the elementalist mages draw their power.

               Fire        Water       Earth       Air

The Positive and Negative Energy Planes - places of almost pure energy
of lack thereof.  The Positive is a place of radiance, where the
power can burn out a traveler in an instant.  The Negative is the
opposite, a place of cold and void, where the spirit is sucked from
the soul.

The Paraelemental Planes - where two adjacent Elemental planes touch.

        Magma (Fire + Earth)                  Smoke (Fire + Air)
        Ooze (Earth + Water)                  Ice (Air + Water)

The Quasielemental Planes - where a Elemental Plane touches the
Positive and Negative.

        Lightning (Air + Positive)            Vacuum (Air + Negative)            
        Mineral (Earth + Positive)            Dust (Earth + Negative)
        Steam (Water + Positive)              Salt (Water + Negative)
        Radiance (Fire + Positive)            Ash (Fire + Negative)

The True Prime may be dangerous to some, but these other planes of
existance are very deadly and should only be attempted by those of great
skill and mental fortitude.

Psionicists don't require a spellbook, however.  When they gain levels, they

Psionicists use mana to cast spells.  They can continue to cast spells until

regenerate mana before they can cast spells again.

Important Attributes: Intelligence, Wisdom

PUT will put an object inside a container.

Some containers have a maximum amount of weight or internal room and will
not hold large or heavy objects.

PUT, as well as most object manipulation commands, allows the use of the
#.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".  This allows a
player to choose a specific item from a group of items with the same keywords.

For example, if you had 3 spellbooks and wanted to put them all in a backpack,
you would type:

     put all.spellbook backpack

Make sure you include the period between the number of the item and the name.
If you used a space in the above example instead of a period, you would attempt
to put everything you had in your inventory into your spellbook.

Certain spells require more power than a single caster can produce.

Please keep in mind the sizes are not simply based on how tall or heavy a
race is.  Other factors such as the strength and physique of the creature
play a part in what size a creature is.  

However, and we can't stress this enough, one of the most important factors
we used was game balance, especially where racewars are considered.  Let's
look at an example:

The ogre is arguably the best warrior class for players on the evil side
of the racewars.  As a huge creature, it can only bash down to medium-large
level, which means it can bash centaurs and barbarians for the most part.
Even reduced, the ogre can only bash medium, which still means most of the
goodie caster races are immune.

This means that race/class combinations that weren't used on Basternae 1
as much are more valuable on Magma.  A duergar warrior, for example,
would have no troubles bashing most of the goodie caster races.  Human and
orc paladins/anti-paladins may not be able to do the damage of the warriors
of a bigger race, but they can keep casters on the ground easier.  It's a
trade-off.

Also notice that some mobs can be larger or smaller than an "average"
creature of that race.  The "enlarge" and "reduce" spells also can affect
a creature's size.</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>0</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>SKILL</Keyword><Text>There are many individual skills in ModernMUD.  The skills can be

</Text></Help><Help><MinimumLevel>-1</MinimumLevel><SeeAlso /><Syntax /><Keyword>STORY</Keyword><Text>The story of the world of ModernMUD 3 is a simple one, but that makes it no
less tragic.

The world is shattered, effectively split in two between the surface world
and that of the Underdark, a massive collections of caves and tunnels that
runs underground.  On the surface, the "good" aligned races make their homes,
while the "evil" races either choose or are forced to live in the dangerous
Underdark.

For all of recorded history, the good and evil races have been at war.
Armies march forward to combat, one side wins and slays the other, then is
destroyed itself by another army.  It is a vicious cycle of warfare and
neither side seems inclined to put a stop to it.  The "good" races talk of
peace, but it's a peace that would cost the lives of all unclean or unpure
races of the dark.  The evil races know only war, trained from birth to live
in hostile environments.  Horrible creatures make their homes in the
Underdark, more than willing to kill any victims for food or sport, but it's
just as likely a young evil will find himself dead from the knife of one of
his kin.

It's the world of ModernMUD, where reflexes and fighting skills are
constantly honed to perfection, where adventure waits around every corner,
and death can lurk behind even the most friendly of faces.  It's a world of
combat and destruction, where fame and forture go to the aggressive and the
meek get stomped into the ground.

masters of picking locks, finding traps, and stealing from friend and foe
alike.  Thieves prefer to skulk in the shadows during combat, waiting for
the opportunity to stab someone in the back.  They have some abilities that
allow them to fight head-to-head, but against a properly trained and equipped
warrior, they probably don't stand a chance.

Important Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility

Races: Human, Grey Elf, Halfling, Mountain Dwarf, Half-Elf, Githzerai, Orc
       Duergar, Githyanki, Flind, Rakshasa

Equipment: Thieves are rogues, and can use most weapons.  Their choice of
           armor is more limited, however, since heavy armor makes sneaking
           in shadows impossible.

Wisdom is a measure of many things: judgement, enlightenment, willpower,

ability to learn from experience.  It is the primary attribute of all

impacts the speed at which one can learn.

Some races naturally are more wise than others.  The mountain dwarves and
their duergar enemies are counted as some of the wisests of the races,
