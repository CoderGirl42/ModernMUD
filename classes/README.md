Classes Directory
-----------------

This directory contains the XML class definition files.

It also includes the Classes.list file, which is the list of races to be loaded
at runtime. This lets you swap classes into and out of the game across boots.
This is not perfect, however, because class numbers and names are hard-coded in
the MUD engine. Ideally all class files would be optional, but we're not there
yet.

There is also a file called "_transform.xsl". This lets you view the class files
in a web browser in a player-friendly manner. This works with Opera,
Chrome/Chromium, and Internet Explorer, but Firefox has buggy handling of XSL
stylesheets and didn't work with it when tested.
