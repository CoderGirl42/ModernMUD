Still needed:

* Allow command scrollback in walkthrough mode.
* Add color to walkthrough mode.
* Set shield spiked flag in object values.
* Help file working under Windows 8 (does it work on other Windows machines?)

Should do:
* Sort race and class names on repop point dlg.
* Add an "open with" link.
* Make 'edit shop' button on mob page create new shop data if clicked when data doesn't exist.
* Make 'edit quests' button on mob page create new quest data if clicked when data doesn't exist.
* Fix special saving and loading -- since they can't be saved and loaded properly as pointers.  Zones will always
  load with a blank special list on mobs and objects.
* Create demo area with at least one of each item (including quest, resets, etc.)
