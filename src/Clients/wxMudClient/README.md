wxMudClient
-----------

The wxMudClient requires wxWidgets 2.9 or newer in order to build. It relies on
the wxRichTextCtrl that was not available before that version.

To customize the client for your MUD, edit MudSettings.h add set your MUD name,
host name, port, and website address. These are used in the title window, about
box, and connect menu entry.
