
TODO for ModernMUD:
-------------------

In addition to things spelled out in the "GOALS.md" and "WISHLIST.md" files in
/docs, these are tasks related to the ModernMUD source code.

To get a full picture of the "to do list", be sure to display the "Task List"
pane in Visual Studio. There are plenty of notes in the source code about things
that are just not right and/or need to be improved.

------------

1. Create an editor for socials.
2. Allow an empty guild file.
